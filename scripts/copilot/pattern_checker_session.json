It accepts a list of file patterns and a list of disallowed patterns as arguments, and scans all files matching the file patterns for the disallowed patterns.\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n./pattern_checker.sh [file patterns] -- [disallowed patterns]\n```\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- `[file patterns]`: A list of file patterns to scan. Each pattern should be quoted and separated by a space. For example, `\"*.dart\" \"*.txt\"`.\n- `[disallowed patterns]`: A list of disallowed patterns to search for in the files. Each pattern should be quoted and separated by a space. For example, `\"pattern1\" \"pattern2\"`.\n\nThe `--` argument is used to separate the file patterns from the disallowed patterns.\n\n### Example:\n\n```bash\n./pattern_checker.sh \"*.dart\" \"*.txt\" -- \"pattern1\" \"pattern2\"\n```\n\nThis command will scan all `.dart` and `.txt` files for the patterns `pattern1` and `pattern2`.\n\n## Output\n\nIf a disallowed pattern is found in a file, the script will print the filename, line number, and the matching line. If any disallowed patterns are found, the script will exit with a status of 1. If no disallowed patterns are found, the script will exit with a status of 0.\n\n---\n\nRemember to make the script executable with the command `chmod +x pattern_checker.sh` before running it.",
